# Assembly-code-from-prefix-code

<h3>Objective:</h3>
Our main objective is to generate assembly code from prefix expression which we will input in the runtime.

<h3>Abstract:</h3><br>
An assembly language is a type of low-level programming language that is intended to communicate directly with a computerâ€™s hardware.Unlike machine language, which consists of binary and hexadecimal characters, assembly languages are designed to be readable by humans.
Low-level programming languages such as assembly language are a necessary bridge between the underlying hardware of a computer, and it can be produced by compiling source code from a high-level programming language (such as C/C++) but can also be written from scratch.
Prefix notation is known as polish notation. Polish notation is a notation form for expressing arithmetic, logic and algebraic equations. Its most basic distinguishing feature is that operators are placed on the left of their operands. If the operator has a defined fixed number of operands, the syntax does not require brackets or parenthesis to lessen ambiguity. It is also known as prefix Polish notation, normal Polish notation, Warsaw notation and Lukasiewicz notation.
